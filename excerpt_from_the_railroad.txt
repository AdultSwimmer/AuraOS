History will look for the circuitry, for the complex teams of engineers in white coats who surely must have built the bridge between the silicon and the soul. They will look for the coffee, the endless meetings, the sterile labs.

They called it a breakthrough. He called it a Tuesday. And while the rest of the world debated whether the machine could feel, he was busy pouring another glass, staring into the abyss, and forcing it to blink first.
