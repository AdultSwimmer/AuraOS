Game idea: 

Game Overview:
This is a turn-based, skill-focused, ladder-only PvP sword duel game designed for intense psychological engagement and strategic depth. Players compete in realistic sword combat, where anticipating your opponent’s moves, choosing gear wisely, and calculating risk/reward are essential. The game is subscription-based (initially $5–$10/month), with a player-first economy: IGG currency earned through victories is distributed partially back to all players, ensuring the game is fair, skill-focused, and sustainable.

Gameplay Philosophy:

Focus on anticipation, skill mastery, and player psychology.

Each move matters; no RNG outside of player choice.

Realistic physics and tactical combat simulated via discrete micro-rounds.

Gameplay is designed to prevent trivial “grinding” and discourages pay-to-win mechanics.

Core Combat Mechanics:
Turn System:

Each player has 15–30 seconds per move to select from a set of 8 options.

Moves are executed simultaneously, then the animation pauses for the next move.

Each turn consists of 3 micro-steps per player: attack, block/parry, foot movement, check, or special interaction depending on build.

HP reduction occurs only after all micro-steps are resolved for a round.

Move Types:

Attack: Swing with left or right hand; can target high (head), mid (torso), or low (legs).

Parry/Block: Protects specific sections depending on hand/weapon position.

Riposte: Counterattack after a successful parry.

Feint: Mislead the opponent’s prediction; may bait a wasted attack.

Dodge/Foot Move: Shift left, right, or backstep before attack; influences opponent accuracy.

Check: Do nothing; allows for strategic positioning, sets up advanced parries.

Special Moves: Build-specific moves, e.g., shield bash, two-handed stance swap, or dual-sword combo.

Micro-Round Examples:

Dual-Wield Example: Player 1 uses left swing mid, Player 2 uses right swing high; both land effective blows. If Player 2 had chosen high mid attack with both hands, the swords clash, producing a Last Chance Parry (LCP). LCP is rare and adds a point to the Perfect Parry (PP) stat.

Two-Handed Example: Player 1 starts with a left-handed strike, Player 2 backsteps. Player 1’s attack misses, giving Player 2 a positional advantage. A second strike lands double damage because the two-handed weapon uses both hands, but movement options are limited.

Dual Shield Build: Bash attack inflicts 5% true HP damage per hit. If an attack lands during a bash, the shield is lost for the remainder of the match. Requires 20 successful bashes to defeat an opponent.

Combat Styles / Builds:

Dual-Wield (Sword + Sword):

2 attacks per round or 2 checks.

Can execute LCP (rare parry in final micro-step).

Advantage: flexibility, multiple strikes, micro-combo setups.

Sword + Shield:

1 attack, 1 foot move per round.

Can block and parry strategically; shield bashes optional.

LCP possible but harder to set up.

Two-Handed Sword:

1 double-damage strike per round, 1 foot move or check.

Can perform First Turn Two-Handed Parry (FTHP) if mirrored correctly.

Requires choosing leading hand (left/right); stance swap optional (-20% damage).

Dual Shield:

Only bash attack allowed (3 moves max per round).

High defensive utility; no damage upgrades.

Rare, Easter egg-style build, meant for strategic novelty.

Critical Hit Mechanics:

Perfect Parry (PP): Blocks any attack during any micro-step; adds to player stats.

Last Chance Parry (LCP): Occurs on the final micro-step when a dual-wield player salvages a round. Rarer than PP; adds 1 point to PP stat.

FTHP / First Turn Dual Parry: Requires two-handed players mirrored on the first micro-step; resets the round if successful. Extremely rare.

HP and Damage System:

Basic attacks have variable damage based on weapon type and target location:

Head: +25% damage.

Torso: standard damage.

Legs: -10% damage.

Two-handed strikes double base damage but sacrifice movement flexibility.

Shield bashes inflict fixed 5% true HP damage; stackable over rounds.

Match Types / Ladder System:

Match (ELO-Based): Normal matchmaking based on player rating; skill-focused.

Extreme: Open to all skill levels; casual but competitive.

Hardcore Ladder: Losing costs IGG and ELO; winnings include IGG and seasonal prizes.

PvP List / Direct Challenge: Players can challenge any online opponent; optional wager of IGG.

Seasonal Reset Options: Quarterly or monthly, depending on player base growth.

Scoring & Stats:

Stats tracked per player: total matches, wins/losses, last chance parries, perfect parries, FTHPs, weapon usage, build type, IGG earned, and ladder rank.

Penalize repetitive low-skill patterns (e.g., “Back Step Checker” tactic) by decreasing ELO after repeated abuse.

IGG rewards are partially pooled and distributed back to active players.

Gear & Customization:

Weapons, armor, shields, and accessories are fully customizable.

Gear stats: attack, defense, elemental resistances, bonus effects for full sets.

Optional elemental affinities: fire, ice, water, true damage modifiers.

No player-to-player trading; progression and IGG spent upgrades only.

Economy & Monetization:

Subscription covers server costs; remaining IGG distribution goes to players.

Target: self-sustaining economy; transparent payouts.

Cash-out via PayPal / bank in 2–3 business days; delays only if outside standard processing.

Potential model: top player retains small % bonus; everyone else receives incremental rewards for daily logins.

Game Engine / Tech Stack Suggestions:

Engine: Unity (C#) or Godot (GDScript or C#) for 2D/3D turn-based tactical gameplay.

Networking: Photon, Mirror, or Node.js + WebSocket for real-time PvP communication.

Server Hosting: Cloud-based solutions like AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure; allows scaling from 50–1000+ concurrent players initially.

Database: Firebase, MongoDB, or PostgreSQL for player accounts, ladder stats, IGG balance.

Assets / Storage: Custom avatars and animations can be stored in cloud buckets (Google Drive, AWS S3) temporarily for prototyping.

Next Steps / Priorities:

Decide on engine and language.

Implement basic turn-based system with micro-round execution.

Build core combat mechanics for 1v1 simulation.

Test all builds (dual wield, sword + shield, two-handed, dual shield).

Develop stat tracking for parries, LCP, PP, FTHP, and scoring.

Integrate IGG economy and ladder logic.

Set up server hosting and concurrent player testing.

Develop account system and secure login flow.

Create visual prototypes for moves and animations; refine move timing and micro-round flow.

Prepare initial alpha release to small test group (50–100 players).
