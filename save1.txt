This page will describe what we do. We are a record label that signs artists, and provides access to recording studio for all signed artists, produces, mix, masters music, assigns the tracks IRSC codes, submits them to radio stations and public online spots (depending on what the artists wants, they can pick radio stations, online platforms like YouTube, Spotify, Apple music, etc -- you can name some more), helps artists book venues and shows if they want, and helps promote music. It's a service that with signed artists all comes for free. 

It's run and owned and operated by Anthony Dulong (me), and I have the permission to create ISRC codes myself, under my record label (Submerged Records) with a unique identifier. I own the recording studio, and I work with multiple people and organazations, like SOCAN and Panorama (formly know as Soproq). 

The mission of this project is to help independent artists get in to a private record label, because not everyone is going to be welcome in like Distrokid (don't include this information like this, because it sounds harsh. I still want everyone to apply. I will be reviewing the music and demos myself, so all submissions are welcome). So word something that sounds really nice and also states that it's a semi-private, or like, hard to get in to? I don't know how to word this properly. But the goal is help indie and singsonger writers that I select that write quality music able to get access to free services, which is everything that they will need -- right here, to be able to book shows, venues, get radio play, get online, get promoted, work with other musicians, get registered music, without having to through a major record label. Something similar to what Subpop does (or did, I'm not sure if they still exist). I will be mostly dealing with alternative rock, punk, metal, grunge, and sub genres of all of that, mostly alternative music, but I don't want to explicitly say that because I don't want people to get scared to apply anyway. If a singer songwriter just sends me an acoustic track and their voice, I'll make the drums, bass and everything else around what they send me (don't really want to say that like that either but I think you get the point). So word that, and all the other stuff up however you'd like. 

If you are going to make multiple paragraphs, add H2 dividers in between each paragraph with an appropriate title if needed. 

If you Google "Anthony Dulong" and "Halifax PC Repair"and "Anty127" you'll find all the ifnormation you need about me and can reword who I am if it is appropriate.
