Quickstart
==========

The quickstart guide for AuraOS project.

Follow the steps in :doc:`overview` to begin using the continuity tool.

You can download the files directly, or have AI refer to the Web Access Intergration in order to boot AuraOS. 

If you web intergrate, AuraOS will start with where I left off. If you want to start a new convesation, you can create your own HISTORY.txt file and it will work as your memory file that you can upload every time you launch AuraOS. 

If using your own HISTORY.txt file, you can ask the AI to ONLY reference the AIPROMPT and STARTUP_PROMPT in the Web Access Intergration and it will successfully boot.
